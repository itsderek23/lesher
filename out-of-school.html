      <h2>Fall '25 - Fort Collins Recreational League</h2>
      <p>
        The city of Fort Collins offers a recreational league open to players in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. The season runs from mid October to mid-December with two practices and one game per week. You can signup to play on a team with other Lesher students.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 7th and 8th grade league is open to players that do not make a school team. We suggest signing up for this league as a backup to the school team as your registration fee is refunded if you make the school team.
      </p>

      <h2>Winter '26 - Competitive Season</h2>
      <p>
        We are forming an affordable, equal playing time, local travel, competitive teams to give students the opportunity to play together more and grow their love of basketball. These teams will play ~12 games in a NoCo competitive league from mid-January to early March with 1-2 practices per week. Total cost is expected to be under $250 per-player, including uniforms. This is entirely volunteer-based with no paid coaches (parents are typically the coaches).
      </p>

      <h3>6th grade competitive team</h3>
      <p>
        We have two roster spots remaining - please email Derek Haynes at <a href="mailto:dhaynes@psdschools.org">dhaynes@psdschools.org</a> if you are interested.
      </p>

      <h3>7th and 8th grade competitive teams</h3>
      <p>
        Please email Derek Haynes at <a href="mailto:dhaynes@psdschools.org">dhaynes@psdschools.org</a> if you are interested in playing or coaching on a competitive team.
      </p>

      <h2>Winter '26 - Fort Collins Intermediate League</h2>
      <p>The intermediate league is a step above the city-run recreational league, but not as competitive as the competitive team. Players are randomly placed on teams although they can request a specific coach.</p>

      <h2>Summer '26 - Open Gyms</h2>
      <p>
        We will be hosting open gyms in the summer for players to come and practice their skills. More details to come.
