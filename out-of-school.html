      <p>
        The school season is compact, lasting from mid-October to mid-December. For players looking for more opportunities to play, improve, and have fun, there are several out-of-school options available throughout the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is our guide of recommended options for 6th-8th grade students.
      </p>

      <h2>Fall '25</h2>

      <h3>Fort Collins Recreational League</h3>

      <p style="font-style: italic;">
        Competition Level: 🏀<br>
        Season Duration: Mid October - Mid December<br>
        Games: ~10<br>
        Game Days: Saturday<br>
        Practices: 2 per week
      </p>

      <p>
        The city of Fort Collins offers a recreational league open to players in 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. You can signup to play on a team with other Lesher students.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 7th and 8th grade league is open to players that do not make a school team. <strong>We suggest signing up for this league as a backup to the school team</strong> as your registration fee is refunded if you make the school team.
      </p>

      <h2>Winter '26</h2>

      <h3>Competitive Season</h3>

      <p style="font-style: italic;">
        Competition Level: 🏀🏀🏀<br/>
        Season Duration: Mid Jan - Early March<br>
        Games: ~12<br>
        Game Days: Saturdays and Sundays, not all weekends. Two games per-day.<br>
        Practices: 1 or 2 per week
      </p>

      <p>
        We are forming an affordable, equal playing time, local travel, competitive teams to give students the opportunity to play together more and grow their love of basketball. We'll play teams from other Northern Colorado cities (Loveland, Windsor, Berthoud, Longmont, etc) with games in Fort Collins and those cities. Total cost is expected to be under $250 per-player, including uniforms. This is entirely volunteer-based with no paid coaches (parents are typically the coaches).
      </p>

      <h4>6th grade competitive team</h4>
      <p>
        We have two roster spots remaining - please email Derek Haynes at <a href="mailto:dhaynes@psdschools.org">dhaynes@psdschools.org</a> if you are interested.
      </p>

      <h4>7th and 8th grade competitive teams</h4>
      <p>
        Please email Derek Haynes at <a href="mailto:dhaynes@psdschools.org">dhaynes@psdschools.org</a> if you are interested in playing or coaching on a competitive team.
      </p>

      <h3>Fort Collins Intermediate League</h3>
      <p style="font-style: italic;">
        Competition Level: 🏀🏀<br/>
        Season Duration: Mid Jan - Early March<br>
        Games: ~12<br>
        Game Days: Friday.<br>
        Practices: 2 per week
      </p>
      <p>The intermediate league is a step above the city-run recreational league, but not as competitive as the competitive team. Players are randomly placed on teams although they can request a specific coach.</p>

      <h2>Summer '26 - Open Gyms</h2>
      <p>
        We will be hosting open gyms in the summer for players to come and practice their skills. More details to come.
