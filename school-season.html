      <h2>General Information</h2>
      <p>
        Basketball is available for 7th and 8th grade students and consists of 36 total players across four teams: varsity, junior varsity, C, and D. Students who do not make the final roster will receive a refund for the athletic fees after tryouts. Each player needs to provide gym shoes and workout clothes for practices. School uniforms are provided during competitions for use for the duration of the season. All participating athletes must be currently enrolled at Lesher and are required to complete the registration process and pay the participation fee prior to tryouts. Please notify coaches of any medical needs that are specific to your child prior to the start of the season (i.e. asthma, etc.).
      </p>

      <p>
        Any student-athlete participating in open gym must have an updated physical form on file with the front office.
